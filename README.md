# apply.fyi for KL

https://apply.fyi/ is a crowdsourced and averaged online and UT Austin salary data and internship application links that lets people see compensation and easily apply to 180+ SWE internships really fast. It's created by Rithwik Pattikonda and I stumbled upon it on Hackathon Hackers facebook group

I'm making a little clone of that for Kuala Lumpur tech internships.


## what needs to be done next:
* Manually gather 10+ initial salary data from the community 
* add UI search (filter) functionality 
* Enable "Add Your Salary" functionality (average multiple incoming salaries for a company)
* Enable "Report Data" functionality 
* Add "Apply" link to each row?
* *What else? Pull Requests are welcome*
* get a domain maybe

## stack
* Google Sheets as backend (reading results as JSON)
* Vue.js for rendering data
